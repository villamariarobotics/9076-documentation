## Introduction

Villaciraptors 9076, a First Robotics team based in Montreal, QC, embarked on its rookie journey just 2 yers ago. We started with just a handful of motivated students and mentors. Since then, we learned a lot from our experiences and challenges. We are now a team with about 40 dedicated members from grades 7 to 11. Each year, our team participates in the FIRST robotics competition, a world-wide competition for high school students.

## Team Mission and Values

We're dedicated to making robotics accessible to all, regardless of engineering skills. Our inclusive, safe and supportive environment encourages teamwork, respect, and lifelong skills. These values extend beyond robotics, shaping culture where every member feels valued and heard. As a new club, we welcome members with any level of experience, ensuring everyone contributes to our robot's creative process.

### Core Values

- **Innovation:** We foster creativity and innovation by encouraging team members to explore new ideas and approaches to solving problems.
- **Collaboration:** We value teamwork and collaboration, recognizing that diverse perspectives and skills are essential for success.
- **Integrity:** We uphold the highest standards of integrity, honesty, and ethical behavior in all team activities and interactions.
- **Continuous Learning:** We promote a culture of lifelong learning, where team members are encouraged to seek knowledge, challenge themselves, and grow both personally and professionally.

## Team Structure

FRC Team 9076 operates under the leadership of experienced students and coaches, who provide guidance, support, and mentorship to team members. The team is organized into several subteams, each responsible for specific aspects of robot design, construction, programming, and outreach.

### Subteams

1. **Mechanical Team:** Responsible for building the physical components of the robot, including chassis, manipulators, and mechanisms.
2. **CAD Team:** The cad team is a mechanical subteam Specializes in designing the core aspects of the robot.
3. **Electrical Team:** Handles the electrical systems of the robot, including wiring, circuit design, and integration of sensors and actuators.
4. **Programming Team:** Develops software for controlling the robot, including autonomous routines, teleoperated controls, and sensor integration.
5. **communications team:** Promotes the team in the community, organizes outreach events, manage and get sponsorships and manages team communications and media relations.

### Leadership

Each respective subteam has its respective subteam lead(s) who is generally in charge of their subteam and assign roles and responsibilities to team members based on their skills, interests, and availability. subteam vice leader(s) take charge of their subteam when the subteam leader is absent or busy with other tasks. This structure includes subteams such as, the cad subteam who themselves have their own leader(s) and vice leader(s)

## Membership and Participation

## Robot Design and Build Process

### Design Phase:

- Analyze game rules and objectives to define the robot's design requirements and constraints.
- Generate and evaluate design concepts, considering factors such as functionality, reliability, and manufacturability.

### Build Phase:

- Collaborate with mechanical, electrical, and programming teams to construct the robot according to the approved design.
- Conduct iterative testing and prototyping to validate design choices and identify areas for improvement.

### Integration Phase:

- Integrate mechanical, electrical, and software components to create a fully functional robot system.
- Conduct comprehensive testing and debugging to ensure that the robot operates reliably and meets competition requirements.
- **GIVE PROGRAMING TIME WITH THE ROBOT!**

## Competition Preparation

### Competitions:

Our team usually takes part in 2 competitions per season, where safety is our top priority to ensure a successful and enjoyable experience for all team members.

1. **BetaBots:** Betabots is a smaller unique offseason game offered exclusively by First Quebec. we participate in this competition as a smaller game before the official first season to get back into the groove of making and designing robots and is great to train new members.
2. **First:** First is the main competition that we participate in, serving as the culmination of our season's efforts and the platform where we showcase our robot's capabilities. It offers an exciting opportunity for our team to compete against other skilled teams and demonstrate our dedication, innovation, and teamwork.

### season schedule:

the season is divided into multiple distinct segments which include:

1. **Recruitment/Preseason:** This segment is during the first few weeks of the school year and are dedicated to meeting up with returning members and recruiting new members, this portion of the year usually also includes some ice breaker and team building workshops.
2. **BetaBots:** This segment of the year is dedicated to the designing and building of a robot for the BetaBots competition and using that robot in the small competition.
3. **Kickoff:** Kickoff is an event usually on a weekend at the beginning of january used to announce the first game simultaneously to all teams participating in that years game. we usually go through the game manual and rules during this weekend and early design ideas and strategies are thrown out.
4. **Build Season:** Build season is a rigorous 6 week segment where the First robot is designed, built wired, programed and tested.
5. **Competition Season:** Competition season is another 6 week segment of the First season dedicated to competing with the First robot. Our team usually participates in 2 events per competition season. If we do very well in these competitions we also have a chance of going to the "First World Championship" which is an annual event hosted in Huston, Texas and is where the top teams battle it out to see who is that years "World Champion".
6. **Post/Off Season:** this segment of the year is after the competition season ends where the team takes things easy and reflect on how de did that year what we did good and what we could have improved and do some learning of new skills and do some offsesaon projects.

### Competition Structure:

### Strategy Development:

- Analyze game strategies and develop match strategies tailored to the team's strengths and objectives.
- Practice and refine match strategies through simulations, scrimmages, and practice matches.

### Logistics and Planning:

- Coordinate travel arrangements, accommodation, and logistics for competition events, ensuring that team members are well-prepared and organized.
- Prepare necessary equipment, tools, spare parts, and supplies for competition, and pack them securely for transport.
- When arriving to competition and setting up the dedicated pits area be sure to refer to and follow the "pits checklist"

### Competition Etiquette:

- Demonstrate good sportsmanship and gracious professionalism towards other teams, referees, and event staff at competitions.
- Follow competition rules and regulations, and respect the decisions of referees and event officials.

## Outreach and Community Engagement

### Mentorship and Collaboration:

- Collaborate with local schools, organizations, and businesses to provide mentorship, support, and resources for robotics and STEM programs.
- Share knowledge and expertise with other teams and students to foster a culture of learning and collaboration within the community.

### Sponsorship and Fundraising:

- Identify and cultivate relationships with potential sponsors and donors to secure financial support and resources for team activities and projects and maintain positive relationships with exesisting sponsors to hopfully keep them coming back in future seasons.
- Organize fundraising events and initiatives to raise funds for team expenses, competition fees, and travel costs.
