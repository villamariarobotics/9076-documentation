# FRC Team 9076 Electrical Handbook

Welcome to the FRC Team 9076 Electrical Handbook! This guide is intended for electrical team members, mentors, and anyone interested in learning more about the electrical systems of our robot.

## Electrical Fundamentals

Before diving into the specifics of our robot's electrical system, let's review some fundamental electrical concepts:

**Voltage (V)**: Electrical potential difference between two points in a circuit, measured in volts (V). Voltage is analogous to pressure in a water pipe, it creates the force that pushes current through the circuit.
**Current (I)**: The flow of electric charge through a conductor, measured in amperes (amps, A). Current is similar to the rate of water flow through a pipe.
**Resistance (R)**: Opposition to electric current flow in a material, measured in ohms (Ω). Resistance is like the narrowness of a pipe, it hinders the flow of current.
These three quantities are interrelated by Ohm's Law: V = IR, where V is voltage, I is current, and R is resistance.

## Electrical Safety

Safety is paramount when working with electricity. Here are some key safety principles:

**Follow general safety rules** As well as these additional rules be sure to follow the general safety rules outlined in the team handbook.
**Always wear safety glasses** when working on electrical components.
**Never work on live circuits** Make sure everything is powered down before touching any electrical components (some exceptions apply).
**Use proper tools and equipment** The right tools will help you complete tasks safely and efficiently.
**Be aware of your surroundings** Keep flammable materials away from electrical components.
**Know where battery leak clean up equipment is located**
**If you're unsure about something, ask a mentor or an experienced member!**

## Our Robot's Electrical System

The electrical system of our robot is the heart and nervous system, powering everything from the motors to the sensors. Here's a general overview of the key components:

**Battery:** Provides the 12V DC power source for the entire robot.

**Power Distribution Hub (PDH):** Distributes power from the battery to different subsystems safely.

**Motor Controllers:** Regulate the speed and direction of the motors based on input from the robot controller.

**Sensors:** Gather data about the robot's environment (e.g., distance, light levels).

**Encoders:** encoders are used to gather data about the angle of rotation or number of rotations of a shaft .

**Vision system:** vision systems are used for vision processing on the robot and include a coprocessor which is usually powered one POE (Power Over Ethernet).

**Roborio:** The "brains" of the robot, process sensor data and send control signals to motors and other actuators.

## Electrical Design and Build Process

The electrical team plays a crucial role in designing, building, and testing the robot's electrical system. Here's a simplified breakdown of the process:

**Design Review:** Electrical team collaborates with other subteams to understand robot requirements and power needs.

**Schematic/diagram Creation:** Develop a schematic or  diagram that illustrates the electrical components and their connections.

**Component Selection:** Choose appropriate electrical components based on specifications and desired functionality.

**Prototyping:** Build a simplified prototype circuit off the robot to test functionality and identify any errors.

**Wiring and Assembly:** wire electrical components onto the robot  and use appropriate connection methods and assembly any components that need it (don’t forget to grease the gearboxes!).

**Testing and Debugging:** Thoroughly test the entire electrical system to ensure it functions as designed.

## Tools and Resources

The electrical team utilizes various tools and resources to complete its tasks. Here are some common examples:

**Multimeter:** Measures voltage, current, and resistance.

**Soldering Iron and Solder:** Used to create permanent electrical connections.

**Wire Strippers and Cutters:** Prepare wires for soldering and connections.

**Heat Shrink Tubing:** Provides insulation and protection for electrical connections.

**Crimpers:** used to add crimp connectors to wire 

**Wago connectors** : used to make non permanent connections with wire 

## Maintaining Electrical Systems

Regular maintenance is vital for optimal robot performance. Electrical team members should:

**Inspect wires and connections** for damage or wear and tear.
**Check motors/components** for wear and replace them if necessary.
**Clean sensors** to ensure accurate data collection.
**Update firmware** on controllers if needed.
**Do a full electrical check** in accordance to the electrical checklist

## Conclusion

The electrical team plays a critical role in the success of FRC Team 9076. By understanding electrical fundamentals, practicing safety, and working collaboratively, the electrical team ensures our robot has the power and control it needs to perform at its best.
